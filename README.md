# HMBGR: Human Microbiome Group R Package
## Zane Billings

This package will provide several functions to assist in generating time species data and modeling logistic growth data using a specific discretized ordinary least squares model, and was designed for use by the Human Microbiome Group at WCU/WWU.

For problems please submit issues on the GitHub page and I will address them as soon as I can; moving all of the old working code into a more organized structure and into this package is an ongoing process.
